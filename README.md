Service to book theatre tickets, using Java Thread and Socket classes

The text of the homework:
<<
•Assumptions: a single show, a single type of ticket
•It must be developed as a concurrent server
•Issue: you mustn’t sell more than the available tickets
•You have to create the classes necessary for the multi-thread communication, and a class ‘‘Reservations’’ with a method without parameters that check if there are free seats:
	•If there are, it returns the number of the reserved seat
	•If there are not, it returns zero
•Check if the synchronization problems are solved by using Thread.sleep()
