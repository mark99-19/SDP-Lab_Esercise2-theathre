The text of the homework:
<br><br>
•Assumptions: a single show, a single type of ticket<br>
•It must be developed as a concurrent server<br>
•Issue: you mustn’t sell more than the available tickets<br>
•You have to create the classes necessary for the multi-thread communication, and a class ‘‘Reservations’’ with a method without parameters that check if there are free seats:<br>
	•If there are, it returns the number of the reserved seat<br>
	•If there are not, it returns zero<br>
•Check if the synchronization problems are solved by using Thread.sleep()<br>
